# Calculator

This is an online calculator. The user can perform basic math operations with it, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user can also perform basic math operations with decimals. There is a button to clear everything. There is also a "backspace" button. The calculator includes keyboard support as well. Here is a guide detailing the keys that correspond to the buttons:

- Number Keys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0
- Operator Keys: +, -, *, /
- Decimal Key: .
- Equals Keys: =, Enter Key
- All Clear Keys: A, a, C, c
- Backspace Keys: B, b, Backspace Key

The calculator has a limit to the number of digits it can store. As a result, it displays an error when the result exceeds a certain value. Note that dividing by 0 also produces an error. The user should clear everything if they reach an error.

I used HTML to create the basic structure of the calculator and CSS (mostly flexbox) to center and style the calculator. I mainly used JavaScript to enable the calculator to function properly. I added event listeners to enable the user to perform basic math operations by clicking the buttons and pressing the corresponding keys.
